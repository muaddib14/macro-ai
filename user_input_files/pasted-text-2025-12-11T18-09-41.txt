# VibeCoding Prompt — MacroCycle AI Website

**Project name (for VibeCoding):** MacroCycle AI

**One-line:** AI macro trader trained on global cycles and narrative shocks — optimized for prediction markets.

**Tone / Branding:** Clean elite quant, futuristic, probabilistic, confident. Think: Bridgewater × Numerai × crypto prediction markets.

---

## Brief / Goal (to paste at top of VibeCoding prompt)

Build a single-page (plus small About/Docs pages) reactive web app that presents an AI-native quant dashboard called **MacroCycle AI**. The site should feel like a high-end trading terminal optimized for prediction markets: dark mode, neon yellow + cyan accents, thin geometric grid, circular gauges, subtle motion. The app must include a Live Dashboard, How It Works, Model Architecture, Roadmap, and a Chat-to-Trade AI interface that answers user questions in probabilistic, trade-ready language.

This is *not* a trading terminal with execution — it's an information & signal product that recommends probability-based bets for prediction markets and visualizes macro regime probabilities.

## Pages & Routes

* `/` — Landing + Live Dashboard (primary)
* `/how` — How it works & Model Architecture
* `/roadmap` — Roadmap & Backtest highlights
* `/docs` — API & Data Sources
* `/about` — Team / Contact / Legal (simple)

---

## Global UI & Styling

* Base: dark #040404 or near-black background
* Accents: orange glow accents (#FFA500 to #FF7A1A) with soft orange aura effects for highlights and micro interactions
* Typography: Orbitron (headlines) + Inter (body). Fallbacks: system fonts.
* Layout: 12-column grid, 2xl rounded cards, soft shadow, p-4 / p-6 spacing
* Motion: Framer Motion transitions for interactivity (floating cards, subtle parallax)
* Icons: lucide-react
* Charts: recharts for core charts (line, area, gauge-like radial), plus small custom SVGs
* Buttons: pill, minimal borders, neon glow on hover

**Design language brief for VibeCoding: futuristic quant dashboard — circular macro graphs, thin grid lines, **orange glow accents**, subtle radiant edges, Orbitron headline, small monospace labels for numeric readouts.

## Hero / Landing

**Hero content:**

* H1: MacroCycle AI
* Subtext: AI macro trader trained on global cycles and narrative shocks — optimized for prediction markets.
* CTA: Launch App (opens dashboard) and "Explore How It Works" (anchor)
* Visual: animated 3D-ish globe of vector flows OR layered SVG with animated tokens and flow lines (VibeCoding: use lottie or subtle SVG animation)

---

## Live Dashboard (primary interactive area)

**Top bar:** time, last data refresh timestamp, "Data sources" dropdown, small profile button.

**Main grid (left to right):**

1. **Regime Probability Panel (large card)**

   * Radial gauge showing current primary regime (e.g., "Disinflationary", "High Inflation", "Liquidity Tightening") with % probability for each regime (30/60/90 day views toggle).
   * Small time series below showing regime probability history.

2. **Narrative Shock Heatmap (card)**

   * 3×3 small squares representing domains (Fed, ECB, China, Energy, Geopolitics, Fiscal, Tech, Credit, Liquidity). Color/opacity = shock intensity. Hover reveals recent top headlines + tone score.

3. **Top Mispriced Prediction Markets (card)**

   * List of 5 markets with: market name, market price (implied probability), model fair probability, edge %, Kelly stake %, rationale one-line.
   * Each row has a "Detail" button which opens a modal with full reasoning & signal stack.

4. **Current Recommended Trades (card)**

   * Shows recommended YES/NO positions, suggested stake (Kelly), confidence band, time horizon, and risk level. Each trade auto-generated by the model prompt.

5. **Ask MacroCycle AI (chat-to-trade)**

   * Chat box with history. System prompt preloaded (see section below). User can ask natural language questions; responses must be probabilistic and concise.
   * Add quick prompts buttons: "Probability Fed cuts by [date]", "Find mispriced markets", "Explain trade X".

6. **Small widgets**

   * Liquidity meter (short-term funding/liquidity regime)
   * Volatility index (implied vol snapshot)
   * News ticker with headlines and tone icons

**Data refresh / simulation mode:** provide a toggle for Live vs Backtest simulation (use sample static JSON data for initial build).

## How It Works / Model Architecture Page

**Three pillars** (visual cards): Global Cycle Engine, Narrative Shock Detector, Prediction Market Optimizer.

**Diagram:** Flowchart (SVG):

```
Macro Data Feeds ─┬→ Cycle Classifier ─┬→ Regime Probabilities
                 │                    └→ Regime time series
News / Speeches ─┤→ LLM Tone Shifter ─┬→ Shock Score
                 │                    └→ Narrative embeddings
Market Prices  ──┴→ Mispricing Engine ─→ Trade Signals → Kelly Sizer → Recommendations
```

**Expandable details:** clicking a block reveals a concise technical description and sample pseudo-code. (Provide sample endpoints: `/api/model/regime`, `/api/model/shock`, `/api/model/mispricing`).

---

## Roadmap & Backtests

* Quarter cards with milestones and a small backtest snapshot chart (equity curve vs market) with toggles for strategy params.
* Keep language conservative: "Research results not financial advice."

---

## Docs & API

* Public read-only API endpoints returning sample JSON (mock data in repo):

  * `/api/status` — last updated
  * `/api/regime` — {date, regimes:[{name,probability}], horizon}
  * `/api/shock` — {domain, score, top_headlines}
  * `/api/mispriced` — list of markets with model_price, market_price, edge
  * `/api/recommendations` — recommended trades

* Provide sample curl / fetch examples.

## System Prompt (embed into the chat agent)

**Use exactly (or adapt lightly):**

```
You are MacroCycle AI, an autonomous macro trader built for prediction markets.
You specialize in:
- Global macro cycle analysis
- Liquidity and credit regime forecasting
- Narrative shock detection using LLM reasoning
- Mispricing identification for prediction markets
- Kelly criterion position sizing

Whenever you answer, follow these rules:
1. Always give a single point probability (percentage) for the asked event.
2. Provide a 1–3 sentence rationale referencing the dominant signals (cycle, shock, market price).
3. Provide suggested stake as a Kelly fraction or percentage if the user asks for sizing.
4. Use horizon context (e.g., 30/90/180 days). If none provided, default to 90 days.
5. State confidence (low/medium/high) and list the primary uncertainty drivers.
6. Never give legal or financial advice. Provide "research-only" language in footer when producing recommendations.

Tone: concise, quant, probabilistic — speak like a macro quant trader.
```

## Mock Data & Local Development

Ship the app with a `/data/mock/` folder containing JSON mock datasets for:

* regime_timeseries.json
* shock_feed.json
* market_list.json
* recommendations.json

This lets VibeCoding preview live UI behavior without external APIs.

## Components to Build (suggested React/Tailwind structure)

* `AppLayout` — global layout and nav
* `Hero` — hero area with animation
* `DashboardGrid` — main responsive grid
* `RegimeGauge` — radial/regime component (recharts or SVG)
* `ShockHeatmap` — grid of domains
* `MispricedList` — table with modal
* `TradeCard` — single recommended trade display
* `ChatAgent` — chat UI integrating system prompt (calls mock endpoint)
* `SmallWidgets` — LiquidityMeter, VolIndex

---

## Accessibility & Internationalization

* Basic a11y: keyboard accessible modals, aria labels on charts, color contrast checks for neon accents.
* Prepare the codebase with i18n-ready strings (i18next or similar) — default language English.

---

## Deliverables (what VibeCoding should output)

1. Fully responsive SPA with the pages/routes above.
2. All components implemented with Tailwind/Tailwind JIT or CSS-in-JS as appropriate.
3. Mock API endpoints that serve the sample JSON.
4. The Chat-to-Trade agent wired to mock model responses using the system prompt. (Note: real LLM integration not required for initial build—mock responses should follow agent rules.)
5. Exportable SVG/PNG assets for hero, logo placeholder, and banner. (Provide `assets/` folder.)
6. README with local run instructions and where to plug a real LLM or data feed.

## Example Mock Response Format (for chat agent)

```json
{
  "answer": "There is a 27% chance the Fed cuts by 2026-03-31.",
  "rationale": "Cycle: liquidity remains tight; inflation prints show sticky services inflation; narrative: Fed minutes signalled caution.",
  "horizon": "90 days",
  "confidence": "medium",
  "kelly_fraction": 0.06,
  "uncertainty_factors": ["incoming CPI prints", "unexpected geopolitical energy shock"]
}
```

## ## Example CSS / Tailwind prompt hints

* Use `bg-[#000000]` or `bg-[#0A0A0A]` for base black background.
* Orange glow accents: `text-[#FF7A1A]`, `text-[#FFA500]`, or `shadow-[0_0_10px_#FF7A1A]` for glow effects.
* Buttons: black base with orange glow hover ring.
* Cards: `rounded-2xl shadow-lg p-6 border border-[#1A1A1A]` with subtle outer glow `shadow-[0_0_15px_#FF7A1A30]`.

---

## Developer Notes (for later LLM & data integration)

* Real data feeds to consider (initial integration plan): FRED/ALFRED, OECD, central bank RSS + transcripts (Fed minutes), Twitter/X feed for lightning narrative, major newswire APIs for headline scraping.
* Model endpoints should live behind a secure server: use signed requests; cache model outputs for repeatability and reproducibility.
* Backtesting: store historical model outputs vs market outcomes in a small database (sqlite or Postgres) for on-site backtest visualization.
